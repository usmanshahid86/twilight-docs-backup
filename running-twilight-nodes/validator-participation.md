# Validator Participation

### Staking & Governance

Validators stake tokens to participate in consensus and secure the network. &#x20;

In return, they earn block rewards and governance rights.



### Testnet Participation

During the testnet:

* &#x20;Validators help test block production and slashing logic.
* &#x20;Incentives may be distributed based on uptime and participation.



### Key Management

* &#x20;Use secure key storage.
* &#x20;Avoid running multiple validator instances with the same key.
