# Connect & Fund Your Wallet

Get started by connecting your Keplr wallet to the Twilight Testnet.

In this short guide, you’ll learn how to link your wallet, approve the network, and claim test tokens (NYKS and SATS) so you can begin exploring the exchange.

***

### 1. Install the Keplr Wallet Extension

Twilight currently supports the **Keplr browser extension** for Testnet access. MetaMask support (via plugin) will be introduced later.

1. Open a Chromium-based browser such as Chrome, Brave, or Edge.
2. Visit the official Chrome Web Store:\
   [https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/keplr/dmkamcknogkgcdfhhbddcghachkejeap](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/keplr/dmkamcknogkgcdfhhbddcghachkejeap)
3. Click **Add to Chrome** → **Add Extension**.
4. Once installed, open Keplr and create or import a wallet.

> Keep your seed phrase secure — it is the only way to recover your wallet.

### 2. Connect Keplr to the Twilight Testnet

1. Go to [https://frontend.twilight.rest](https://frontend.twilight.rest).
2. Click **Connect Wallet** in the upper-right corner.
3. Keplr will prompt you to **Add Twilight Testnet chain**.

6. Keplr will automatically switch to the **Twilight Testnet** once approved.

Your wallet is now connected to the Twilight environment.

### 3. Fund Your Wallet with Testnet Tokens

Before you can trade or provide liquidity, your wallet needs two types of test tokens:

| Token    | Purpose    | Description                                            |
| -------- | ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| **NYKS** | Gas Fees   | Used to pay transaction fees on the Nyks chain.        |
| **SATS** | Collateral | Represents testnet BTC used for trading and liquidity. |

#### Claim Tokens from the Faucet

1. Open the [Faucet](https://frontend.twilight.rest/faucet) page on the Twilight Top Menu.

2. Connect your Keplr wallet if not already connected.
3. Click **Get NYKS Tokens** to receive your initial gas balance.
4. Once confirmed, click **Register BTC Address** to create and register your SATS public key.
   * Do not refresh or close the page during this step.
   * Approve the transaction in Keplr when prompted.
5. After the BTC address registration completes, click **Get SATS Tokens** to receive your testnet SATS balance.
